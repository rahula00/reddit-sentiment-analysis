<h1>Sentiment Sentiment Analysis: Reddit Headlines and Comments</h1>


Set reddit client id, secret, and user agent in "combined.py" to run code.


<p>We use pre-trained VADER models in Python's natural language toolkit(NLTK) to perform sentiment analysis on headlines and comments of Reddit posts. Our testing is done across 5 subreddits, with 1000 posts/headlines for each subreddit and 100 comments for each post. We find that posts with positive headlines tend to have a larger proportion of positive comments, while posts with negative headlines tend to have a larger proportion of negative comments. </p>

<h1>Sentiment Sentiment Analysis: Reddit Headlines and Comments</h1>

<p>We use pre-trained VADER models in Python's natural language toolkit(NLTK) to perform sentiment analysis on headlines and comments of Reddit posts. Our testing is done across 5 subreddits, with 1000 posts/headlines for each subreddit and 100 comments for each post. We find that posts with positive headlines tend to have a larger proportion of positive comments, while posts with negative headlines tend to have a larger proportion of negative comments. </p>

<h4>Running Code</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Set reddit client id, secret, and user agent in "combined.py" to run code. A reddit account is required. </li>
  <li>Optionally set a post limit and your desired subreddits in the variables "postLimit" and "subreddits." We recommend setting the post limit to <10 for testing. /li>
  <li>Output is in the format subreddit_headlines_labels.csv and subreddit_comment_labels.csv. For each subreddit, the headlines csv files contain unique post IDs for the posts being analyzed, as well as a negative/neutral/positive label (-1, 0, 1). Similarly, the comments csv file contains the unique post IDs for the posts being analyzed and the distribution and number of comments matching each sentiment label (-1, 0, 1) for each post ID. </li>
